# Career Hub - Discover

A prototype for a systems pitch to hopefully have the opportunity to implement a system into my University. 

## What does this system do?

This system takes your interests and subject of study and shows you all the events and societies you could be getting involved with. To me, getting involved is a lot more important than working all the time. You want to diversify your time and work on all different types of projects

## How does it work?

At the moment it's just some dynamic webpages linked together. The end goal is to implement this project into other projects my friends have started. Using web scraping and hopefully django to make this into a fully updatable system. For the end product we want a back-end and a front-end. We want the back-end to be one big database that pulls the information relevant to you!

## Working on this.
